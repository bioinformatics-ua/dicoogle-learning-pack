## Building

First install `jekyll` and `bundle` using Ruby gems (v2 or v3).

```sh
gem install jekyll bundler
```

On the project's base directory, install the necessary dependencies, then serve the site:

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site is now being served at port 4000.
