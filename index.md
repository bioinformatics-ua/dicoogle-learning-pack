title: Welcome to the Dicoogle Learning Pack

This is a set of tutorials and resources for setting up an instance of Dicoogle, as well as for developing compatible plugins. The contents of the Dicoogle Learning Pack are targeted at future users of Dicoogle, including students and researchers.
In this site, you will receive guidance on:

 - Setting up a PACS archive with basic storage and querying capabilities;
 - Using Dicoogle from its web application;
 - Configuring the PACS archive and its plugins;
 - Developing your own plugins for Dicoogle.

Throughout this site, you may find the following notes:
