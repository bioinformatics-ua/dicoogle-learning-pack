# Introduction

- The increasing investments in information technologies have led to improvements and methodologies to assess:
  - Performance, efficiency, quality of service.

- Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS)

---

# Introduction

- File-based repositories rely on the _DICOM_ standard for image storage and communication in a PACS.
--

- Multiple forms of information exist.
   - Meta-data: information related to the examination, the patient's demographics, clinical staff, acquisition device, etc.
   - Image data: image or video, often of unconventional bit depths and resolutions.
   - Medical reports: can be structured or unstructured.

# Introduction

- The requirements of medical imaging systems are ever increasing.
  - Imaging data output becomes larger and more frequent (Big Data).
  - New and enhanced modalities are emerging (whole-slide microscopy, PET/MRI, ...).
- Information retrieval is important
  - Improved radiology workflows, teaching, researching.
  - New ways to search over medical imaging data.
--

- The great majority of installed information system do not allow such kind of analysis (limited indexing capabilities).
- Few systems enable institutions to continuously monitor and measure the efficiency of medical imaging data produced.
- DICOM compliance is insufficient for state-of-the-art retrieval capabilities (free text search, query-by-example, ...).


---

# Motivation

- Secondary use of DICOM meta-data.
- Evaluate and integrate developed tools in multiple case studies.
   - Database technologies (SQL, NoSQL, ...);
   - Image recognition (computer-assisted detection, content-based image retrieval, ...);
- Knowledge extraction.
   - Obtain healthcare quality indicators.
   - Analyses of the workflow and productivity.


---

# .center[![](img/dicoogle-logo.svg)]

- Extensible, platform-independent, open-source PACS archive;
- Designed to embrace advanced indexing mechanisms and knowledge extraction from medical imaging information;
- Over 25 million images were indexed in Aveiro, Portugal;
- Has fulfilled a multitude of use cases in research and industry.

--

### The user can:

- Index DICOM files
- Quick DIM navigation
- Navigate over meta-data
- Free text searching
- Perform advanced boolean queries
- Export data to CSV

# Getting Started

- Start by [downloading](http://www.dicoogle.com/downloads/) Dicoogle and base plugins.
   - Or build them from the sources.

- Requires Java 7 (Java 8 recommended).

--

- Copy _"dicoogle.jar"_ to a new folder (e.g. _"DicoogleDir"_).
- Copy the plugin jar files to **Plugins** subfolder (e.g. _"DicoogleDir/Plugins"_).
- `java -jar dicoogle.jar`
- The [Setup](https://bioinformatics-ua.github.io/dicoogle-learning-pack/docs/setup) page of the Learning Pack will guide you with further detail.

---

# Using Dicoogle

Enter the webapp: <http://localhost:8080>

![The login page of the web app.](img/screenshot_login.png)

.center[
username: `dicoogle` <br> password: `dicoogle`
]

---

# Using Dicoogle

- Grab a DICOM data set.

--

- Force Dicoogle to index the set.

## Developing for Dicoogle

<br><br>

---

# Core Architecture

<img src="img/architecture.png" width="70%"></img>

---

# Plugin-based Development

.col-2[A plugin is:

- An extension to Dicoogle.
- Developed and bundled separately.
- Loaded at Dicoogle runtime.
- A set of components implementing common APIs
]

<img src="img/diagram-plugin-load.png" width="77%"></img>

---

# Dicoogle SDK

 - Defines common APIs (Storage, Query, Index, ...).
 - Provides additional data structures and libraries.
--

 - `PluginSet` contains a set of these plugins.

<img src="img/diagram-plugins.svg" width="76%"></img>

--

Web UI plugins are different ([read more](https://bioinformatics-ua.github.io/dicoogle-learning-pack/docs/webplugins))

---

# Dicoogle Plugin Types

- **Storage**: provide access to persistent file/blob storages.

- **Indexer**: implement data indexing for efficient searching

- **Query**: enable search through indexed content

- **Servlet** (Jetty): web services implemented with servlets.

- **RESTlet**: web services implemented using RESTlet server resources.

--

- **~~Graphical~~**: obsolete

- **Web UI**: Implemented in JavaScript; extend the web user interface.

---

# Creating a Plugin

- Create a `PluginSet` implementation and build a jar.

----

- Grab our sample: [github.com/bioinformatics-ua/dicoogle-plugin-sample](https://github.com/bioinformatics-ua/dicoogle-plugin-sample)
--

- Inspect the project's sources.
  - Where is the plugin set?
  - What APIs do the plugins implement, and which methods?

--
- Build and test them on Dicoogle.
- You can start your own plugins from this one.
